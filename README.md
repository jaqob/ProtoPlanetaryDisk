A VERY rudimentary protoplanetary disk gravity simulator. 

Available commands:
 * t - Toggle trails
 * c - Focus on the object with the highest mass.
 * &#8593; - Zoom out
 * &#8595; - Zoom in
 * &#8592; - Speed down
 * &#8594; - Speed up

A click with the left mouse button focuses on the closest object. <br><br>
